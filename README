A small ruby app that prints a multiplication table of prime numbers.

It uses a simplistic incremental Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find primes based on this academic paper: http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/papers/Sieve-JFP.pdf


Instructions
============

Â   > gem install primetable
   > primetable 10

This will print the first 10 prime numbers.  You can try raising that number and seeing how far you can go.
